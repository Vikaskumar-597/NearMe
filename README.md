             **  Meenakshi Amman Temple, temple complex in Madurai, Tamil Nadu state, India, said to originally date as far back as the 4th century CE but in its present form built in the 16th–17th centuries.
               According to Hindu legend, the god Shiva came to Madurai in the form of Sundareswarar to marry Meenakshi, the daughter of the Pandya ruler; Meenakshi was a manifestation of the goddess Parvati.
               The Meenakshi Amman Temple is dedicated to their union. <br><br>
            **   The massive temple is enclosed by high walls entered through soaring gopuras, or gateway towers.
               Inside are colonnades, columned mandapas (halls, some of which were used for shops, storerooms, and stables), a sacred tank, lesser shrines, and, at the centre, the two main shrines to Sundareswarar and Meenakshi. 
               The gopuras are some of the most elaborately decorated in India. <br><br>
             **  Brightly painted, they are completely covered with figures of divinities, celestial beings, monster masks, guardians, and animal mounts. The tallest of the 14, the southern gopura, rises to more than 170 feet (52 m).
               Within the temple complex is the magnificent Aiyaram Kal Mandapa (Thousand-Pillar Hall), which in fact contains 985 columns carved with divinities, female musicians, and attendant figures.<br><br>
             **  The Pottamarai Kulam (Golden Lotus Pond), a large pool where devotees can bathe in holy water, is surrounded by a colonnade whose walls are decorated with murals depicting the miracles Shiva performed in Madurai.
               A doorway in the west wall leads to the Meenakshi shrine. This stands in its own enclosure, within which are several subsidiary shrines, together with the bedchamber, where the image of Sundareswarar is brought every night from its own shrine.<br><br>

            *** Three thousand years old Tamils habitation was found in the excavations.
            After that Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department started excavation work from the 4th to 8th phase from 2017 to 2019. 
            A variety of items were found in it.<br><br>

            *** The Keeladi excavations are archaeological excavations that have been taking place in the village of Keeladi, located in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, since 2014. 
            The excavations have been carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and have unearthed significant evidence of an ancient urban settlement.<br><br>

            *** The Keeladi site dates back to the Sangam period, considered the golden age of Tamil literature and lasted from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE. 
            The excavations have revealed a complex urban settlement that included residential areas, streets, public buildings, and water management systems.<br><br>

            *** Some crucial findings from the Keeladi excavations include beads, iron tools, terracotta figurines, expensive gold ornaments, copper articles, iron tool parts, flint pieces, round chips, flint earrings,
             glass and precious bell stones (agate, sapphire, crystal), earthenware shells, revoluted pottery, old men's talismans etc. 
            These artefacts provide valuable insights into the life and culture of the people who lived in the area during the Sangam period. <br><br>

            *** It has been established that the Tamils inhabited the area with an ancient urban civilisation. 
            The period between the 6th century BC and the 1st and 2nd century BC has been confirmed by the organic samples of material recovered in Phase 4 excavations.
            Scratches, symbols and patterns were found on the pottery found here. All these are engraved before and after firing. 
            Over 50 pieces of clay inscribed with Tamil Brahmi characters have been recovered.<br><br>

            *** Madurai airfield was first used by the Royal Air Force in World War II in 1942. 
            The first passenger flight was a Fokker Friendship aircraft on the Madras – Madurai – Thiruvananthapuram – Madurai – Madras route in 1956.
            It was identified as one of 35 non-metro airports for modernisation, and thus the new integrated terminal building was inaugurated on 12 September 2010.<br><br>
            
            *** The airport was notified as customs airport. The notification, issued on 31 December 2011, came into effect from 1 January 2012. 
            Two chartered flights from Malaysia landed at the airport on 25 August 2012, making them the first international aircraft to land in the city. 
            The first commercial international flight began on 20 September 2012 by SpiceJet commencing its maiden service to Colombo.<br><br>
            
            *** To boost exports from Madurai and its surrounding districts, the Department of Revenue under the Union Ministry of Finance issued a notification dated 28 May 2013 permitting the airport to handle cargo. 
            The cargo terminal became operational from 15 December 2017.[13] From 17 October 2018, E-visa on arrival facility has been introduced in Madurai airport which sets a base for a proper international airport infrastructure at Madurai which boosted tourism at Madurai. 
            Since Madurai airport is not in a part of the BASA Agreement, it is difficult to operate international air carriers from Madurai to various countries. 
            The airport also started to function 24×7 from 1st October 2024.<br><br>

            *** Airports Authority of India (AAI) is considering providing a new terminal building for Madurai Airport in view of increased passenger traffic.
            The AAI Regional Executive Director said that performance of the airport on all fronts was good, especially the 35% growth in passenger movement reported in the year 2016-2017. 
            The feasibility of expanding the terminal building is being studied. If that is not possible, a new building will be constructed, which is already in the airport master plan.<br><br>
