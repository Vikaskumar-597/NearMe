            *** Madurai airfield was first used by the Royal Air Force in World War II in 1942. 
            The first passenger flight was a Fokker Friendship aircraft on the Madras – Madurai – Thiruvananthapuram – Madurai – Madras route in 1956.
            It was identified as one of 35 non-metro airports for modernisation, and thus the new integrated terminal building was inaugurated on 12 September 2010.<br><br>
            
            *** The airport was notified as customs airport. The notification, issued on 31 December 2011, came into effect from 1 January 2012. 
            Two chartered flights from Malaysia landed at the airport on 25 August 2012, making them the first international aircraft to land in the city. 
            The first commercial international flight began on 20 September 2012 by SpiceJet commencing its maiden service to Colombo.<br><br>
            
            *** To boost exports from Madurai and its surrounding districts, the Department of Revenue under the Union Ministry of Finance issued a notification dated 28 May 2013 permitting the airport to handle cargo. 
            The cargo terminal became operational from 15 December 2017.[13] From 17 October 2018, E-visa on arrival facility has been introduced in Madurai airport which sets a base for a proper international airport infrastructure at Madurai which boosted tourism at Madurai. 
            Since Madurai airport is not in a part of the BASA Agreement, it is difficult to operate international air carriers from Madurai to various countries. 
            The airport also started to function 24×7 from 1st October 2024.<br><br>

            *** Airports Authority of India (AAI) is considering providing a new terminal building for Madurai Airport in view of increased passenger traffic.
            The AAI Regional Executive Director said that performance of the airport on all fronts was good, especially the 35% growth in passenger movement reported in the year 2016-2017. 
            The feasibility of expanding the terminal building is being studied. If that is not possible, a new building will be constructed, which is already in the airport master plan.<br><br>
