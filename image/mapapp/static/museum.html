            *** Three thousand years old Tamils habitation was found in the excavations.
            After that Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department started excavation work from the 4th to 8th phase from 2017 to 2019. 
            A variety of items were found in it.<br><br>

            *** The Keeladi excavations are archaeological excavations that have been taking place in the village of Keeladi, located in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, since 2014. 
            The excavations have been carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and have unearthed significant evidence of an ancient urban settlement.<br><br>

            *** The Keeladi site dates back to the Sangam period, considered the golden age of Tamil literature and lasted from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE. 
            The excavations have revealed a complex urban settlement that included residential areas, streets, public buildings, and water management systems.<br><br>

            *** Some crucial findings from the Keeladi excavations include beads, iron tools, terracotta figurines, expensive gold ornaments, copper articles, iron tool parts, flint pieces, round chips, flint earrings,
             glass and precious bell stones (agate, sapphire, crystal), earthenware shells, revoluted pottery, old men's talismans etc. 
            These artefacts provide valuable insights into the life and culture of the people who lived in the area during the Sangam period. <br><br>

            *** It has been established that the Tamils inhabited the area with an ancient urban civilisation. 
            The period between the 6th century BC and the 1st and 2nd century BC has been confirmed by the organic samples of material recovered in Phase 4 excavations.
            Scratches, symbols and patterns were found on the pottery found here. All these are engraved before and after firing. 
            Over 50 pieces of clay inscribed with Tamil Brahmi characters have been recovered.<br><br>

            *** During each excavation phase, more than 3 thousand objects were taken by the archaeology department. 
            In this, 5,820 items were found by the archaeology department only during the 4th phase of excavation. So far, 8 phases of excavations have been completed. 
            All the finds are examples of the excellence of the ancient Tamils in urban civilisation<br><br>
