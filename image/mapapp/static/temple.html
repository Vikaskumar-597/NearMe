             **  Meenakshi Amman Temple, temple complex in Madurai, Tamil Nadu state, India, said to originally date as far back as the 4th century CE but in its present form built in the 16thâ€“17th centuries.
               According to Hindu legend, the god Shiva came to Madurai in the form of Sundareswarar to marry Meenakshi, the daughter of the Pandya ruler; Meenakshi was a manifestation of the goddess Parvati.
               The Meenakshi Amman Temple is dedicated to their union. <br><br>
            **   The massive temple is enclosed by high walls entered through soaring gopuras, or gateway towers.
               Inside are colonnades, columned mandapas (halls, some of which were used for shops, storerooms, and stables), a sacred tank, lesser shrines, and, at the centre, the two main shrines to Sundareswarar and Meenakshi. 
               The gopuras are some of the most elaborately decorated in India. <br><br>
             **  Brightly painted, they are completely covered with figures of divinities, celestial beings, monster masks, guardians, and animal mounts. The tallest of the 14, the southern gopura, rises to more than 170 feet (52 m).
               Within the temple complex is the magnificent Aiyaram Kal Mandapa (Thousand-Pillar Hall), which in fact contains 985 columns carved with divinities, female musicians, and attendant figures.<br><br>
             **  The Pottamarai Kulam (Golden Lotus Pond), a large pool where devotees can bathe in holy water, is surrounded by a colonnade whose walls are decorated with murals depicting the miracles Shiva performed in Madurai.
               A doorway in the west wall leads to the Meenakshi shrine. This stands in its own enclosure, within which are several subsidiary shrines, together with the bedchamber, where the image of Sundareswarar is brought every night from its own shrine.<br><br>
